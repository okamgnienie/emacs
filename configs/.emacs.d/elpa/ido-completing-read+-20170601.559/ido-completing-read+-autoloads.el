ido-based method for reading from the minibuffer with completion.

See `completing-read' for the meaning of the arguments.

This function is a wrapper for `ido-completing-read' designed to
be used as the value of `completing-read-function'. Importantly,
it detects edge cases that ido cannot handle and uses normal
completion for them.

Variable holding the command used for switching to another completion mode.

This variable is originally declared in `ido.el', but it is not
given a value (or a docstring). This documentation comes from a
re-declaration in `ido-completing-read+.el' that initializes it
to nil, which should suppress some byte-compilation warnings in
Emacs 25. Setting another package's variable is not safe in
general, but in this case it should be, because ido always
let-binds this variable before using it, so the initial value
shouldn't matter.")
